# Dam Damage Detection Python API

This contains the Python API for the Dam Damage Detection application.

Needs to be run on a Linux machine.

It requires the database from the DamDamageDetection repo, as well as having SITL and Gazibo ROS set up on the machine.

After everything is up and running just run the Flask server.

This project also contains the Jupyter Notebook file used for designing the base machine learning model.
